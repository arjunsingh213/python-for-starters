#This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")

print("Hello, World!") #This is a comment

#multiline comments
#This is a comment
#written in
#more than just one line
print("Hello, World!")

#Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it:
"""
This is a comment
written in
more than just one line
"""
print("Hello, World!")
