#If you have a collection of values in a list, tuple etc. Python allows you to extract the values into variables. This is called unpacking.


fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
x, y, z = fruits
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

#The Python print() function is often used to output variables.
x = "Python is awesome"
print(x)

#You can also use the + operator to output multiple variables:
x = "Python "
y = "is "
z = "awesome"
print(x + y + z)
